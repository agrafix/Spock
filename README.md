## Intro

Hackage: [Spock](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock)
Stackage: [Spock](https://www.stackage.org/package/Spock)

Another Haskell web framework for rapid development


## Library Usage Example

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Web.Spock

import qualified Data.Text as T

main =
    runSpock 3000 $ spockT id $
    do get ("echo" <//> var) $ \something ->
        text $ T.concat ["Echo: ", something]

```

## Install

* Using cabal: `cabal install Spock`
* Using Stack: `stack install Spock`
* From Source (cabal): `git clone https://github.com/agrafix/Spock.git && cd Spock && cabal install`
* From Source (stack): `git clone https://github.com/agrafix/Spock.git && cd Spock && stack build`

## Features

Another Haskell web framework for rapid development: This toolbox provides
everything you need to get a quick start into web hacking with haskell:

* fast typesafe routing
* middleware
* json
* sessions
* cookies
* database helper
* csrf-protection
* typesafe contexts

## Candy

### Extensions

The following Spock extensions exist:

* Background workers for Spock: [Spock-worker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock-worker)
* Digestive functors for Spock: [Spock-digestive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock-digestive)

### Works well with Spock

* User management [users](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/users)
* Data validation [validate-input](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/validate-input)
* Blaze bootstrap helpers [blaze-bootstrap](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-bootstrap)
* digestive-forms bootstrap helpers [digestive-bootstrap](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/digestive-bootstrap)

### SSL / HTTPS

If you'd like to use your application via HTTPS, there are two options:

* Use nginx/haproxy/... as reverse proxy in front of the Spock application.
* Convert the Spock application to a `wai`-application using the `spockAsApp`. Then use the `warp-tls` package to run it.

## Notes

Since version 0.11.0.0 Spock drops simple routing in favor of typesafe routing.

Since version 0.7.0.0 Spock supports typesafe routing. If you wish to continue using the untyped version of Spock you can Use `Web.Spock.Simple`. The implementation of the routing is implemented in a separate haskell package called `reroute`.

Since version 0.5.0.0 Spock is no longer built on top of scotty. The
design and interface is still influenced by scotty, but the internal
implementation differs from scotty's.
