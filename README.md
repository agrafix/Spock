## Intro

Another Haskell web framework for rapid development. To get started with Spock, check our [tutorial](https://www.spock.li/tutorial/)
or take a look at our example project [funblog](https://github.com/agrafix/funblog)!

## Features

Another Haskell web framework for rapid development: This toolbox provides
everything you need to get a quick start into web hacking with haskell:

* fast typesafe routing
* middleware
* json
* sessions
* cookies
* database helper
* csrf-protection
* typesafe contexts

### Extensions

The following Spock extensions exist:

* Background workers for Spock: [Spock-worker](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock-worker)
* Digestive functors for Spock: [Spock-digestive](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock-digestive)
* Lucid for Spock: [Spock-lucid](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Spock-lucid)

### Works well with Spock

* User management [users](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/users)
* Data validation [validate-input](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/validate-input)
* Blaze bootstrap helpers [blaze-bootstrap](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/blaze-bootstrap)
* digestive-forms bootstrap helpers [digestive-bootstrap](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/digestive-bootstrap)

### SSL / HTTPS

If you'd like to use your application via HTTPS, there are two options:

* Use nginx/haproxy/... as reverse proxy in front of the Spock application.
* Convert the Spock application to a `wai`-application using the `spockAsApp`. Then use the `warp-tls` package to run it.

## Notes

Since version 0.11.0.0 Spock drops simple routing in favor of typesafe routing and drops safe actions in favor of the "usual" way of csrf protection with a token.

Since version 0.7.0.0 Spock supports typesafe routing. If you wish to continue using the untyped version of Spock you can Use `Web.Spock.Simple`. The implementation of the routing is implemented in a separate haskell package called `reroute`.

Since version 0.5.0.0 Spock is no longer built on top of scotty. The
design and interface is still influenced by scotty, but the internal
implementation differs from scotty's.
