Today I am launching the website for the Haskell web framework Spock. Currently, there is a short homepage to market the framework, a beginners tutorial and some helpful links. Over time I plan to add more tutorials and will write about releases and new features. Guest posts are welcome, too. If you have anything you'd like to share about Spock (that can be technical or just an experience report), feel free to contact me at [mail@athiemann.net](mailto:mail@athiemann.net).

For now, enjoy the site and the framework - hope to see you back soon!
