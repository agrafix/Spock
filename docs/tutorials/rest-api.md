# Overview

In this tutorial, we're going to use Spock to build a simple RESTful API
that will let us add people to a database and then retrieve a list of who
we've added. For example:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Walter", "age": 50 }' localhost:8080/people
{"result":"success","id":1}

$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Jesse", "age": 22 }' localhost:8080/people
{"result":"success","id":2}

$ curl localhost:8080/people
[{"age":50,"name":"Walter","id":1},{"age":22,"name":"Jesse","id":2}]
```

We'll be using [curl](//curl.haxx.se/) to interact with our API so you should have
that or another way to perform HTTP requests. `curl` examples are provided throughout
the tutorial.

You can find the finished code
[here](//github.com/brynedwards/spock-tutorials/tree/9076c2e0f887dab0bd1758b937d630cdcb9555df/rest-api). "part1"
covers up to Adding a Database; "part2" covers up to Finishing up. 

# Project Setup

Before using Spock, you'll need to install the Haskell toolchain on your
machine. We recommend using the [stack](//haskellstack.org/) tool to
quickly get started! Our guide will be `stack` based, but you can easily
translate this to `cabal`.  Next, you can prepare a directory for your first
Spock powered application:

1. Create a new project using `stack new Spock-rest`
2. Jump into the directory `cd Spock-rest`

### Dependencies

To make sure your dependencies will match those used in this tutorial, set
your project to use Stackage LTS 8.13: Open your `stack.yaml` file, find the
`resolver` key and make sure its value is `lts-8.13`.

Next, you're going to add the packages you'll be using: `Spock`, `aeson`
and `text`. To do this, open your `Spock-rest.cabal` file, find the
`executable Spock-rest-exe` section and add `aeson`, `Spock` and `text`
to the `build-depends` key. There should also be a `Spock-rest` entry which
you can remove or just ignore. The result should look something like this:

```
  build-depends:         base
                       , aeson
                       , Spock
                       , text
```

### Imports

Let's start by adding a couple of language extensions and imports. Open
`app/Main.hs` and replace the content with:

{% highlight haskell %}

{-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

import           Web.Spock
import           Web.Spock.Config

import           Data.Aeson       hiding (json)
import           Data.Monoid      ((<>))
import           Data.Text        (Text, pack)
import           GHC.Generics

{% endhighlight %}

We'll be using the `DeriveGeneric` extension along with `GHC.Generics`
to create `FromJSON` and `ToJSON` instances of our API type.
The `Data.Aeson` library provides our JSON type conversion; you can view its
[documentation]({{ page.hackage_base }}/aeson-1.1.2.0/docs/Data-Aeson.html#g:1)
to learn more.

# API Type

Now we'll create a data type for our API. Add the following to your `Main.hs`,
below the import statements:

{% highlight haskell %}

data Person = Person
  { name :: Text
  , age  :: Int
  } deriving (Generic, Show)

instance ToJSON Person

instance FromJSON Person

{% endhighlight %}

We can try out our new Person type in GHCi: run `stack ghci` in your
project root directory to build your project and start a REPL session. Try
using `encode` and `decode` to serialise and deserialise `Person`s into
`ByteString`s like so:

```
λ> encode Person { name = "Leela", age = 25 }
"{\"age\":25,\"name\":\"Leela\"}"

-- So our string literal can inferred as a ByteString
λ> :set -XOverloadedStrings
λ> decode "{ \"name\": \"Amy\", \"age\": 30 }" :: Maybe Person
Just (Person {name = "Amy", age = 30}) 
```

Aeson's `decode` type signature is:

{% highlight haskell %}
FromJSON a => ByteString -> Maybe a
{% endhighlight %}

So we have to tell GHCi what we want type we want it to try decode our bytestring as,
otherwise it will default to (). We can also decode it as Aeson's generic `Value` type:

```
λ> decode "{ \"name\": \"Amy\", \"age\": 30 }" :: Maybe Value
Just (Object (fromList [("age",Number 30.0),("name",String "Amy")]))
```

# Serving JSON

Now we'll add a basic Spock application to serve our JSON. Add the
following to your `Main.hs`:

{% highlight haskell %}

type Api = SpockM () () () ()

type ApiAction a = SpockAction () () () a

main :: IO ()
main = do
  spockCfg <- defaultSpockCfg () PCNoDatabase ()
  runSpock 8080 (spock spockCfg app)

app :: Api
app = do
  get "people" $ do
    json $ Person { name = "Fry", age = 25 }

{% endhighlight %}

Our `Api` type represents our application's configuration. In the second
part we'll be modifying it to add a database backend, but for now we'll
leave all the types as Unit. Our `ApiAction` type is similar and represents
actions in our application which are functions performed by route matches
(e.g. `get "people"`). We'll be using `ApiAction` later to explicitly declare
some types used in actions.

Spock includes a `json` function for serving any type that implements the
`ToJSON` typeclass, which means you can pass your `Person` and it will encode
it as JSON and set the HTTP Content-Type header to `application/json` for
you. You can start the server in GHCi by first reloading the project using
the `:reload` command then running your `main` function:

```
λ> :reload
[2 of 2] Compiling Main
Ok, modules loaded: Lib, Main.

λ> main
Spock is running on port 8080 
```

Go to [localhost:8080/people](//localhost:8080/people) and you should
see your `Person` object in JSON.

REST APIs also need to serve lists of items; since `aeson` includes a `ToJSON
a => ToJSON [a]` instance, we can easily serve a list of `Person`s. Change
your `get` function to the following:

{% highlight haskell %}

  get "people" $ do
    json [Person { name = "Fry", age = 25 }, Person { name = "Bender", age = 4 }]

{% endhighlight %}

Enter `ctrl-c` in GHCi to interrupt the server and get back to the prompt. Then,
reload your project and start the server again. Refresh your browser to see
your two `Person`s in a JSON array.

# Parsing JSON

Now we'll write a second route that will attempt to parse a POST body into our
`Person` type. Add the following to the bottom of your `app` declaration:

{% highlight haskell %}

  post "people" $ do
    thePerson <- jsonBody' :: ApiAction Person
    text $ "Parsed: " <> pack (show thePerson)
      
{% endhighlight %}

Reload your project and start the server again. We'll need to make a POST
request to try out our new code. Here's a way of doing so using `curl`:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Bart", "age": 10 }' localhost:8080/people
Parsed: Person {name = "Bart", age = 10}
```

You can also try adding extra keys to your JSON object or removing name and
age and seeing what happens.

# Adding a Database

Now that we've seen how to do some simple REST-style requests, we'll add
a database to our application so we can provide proper API functionality.
We're going to be using the Persistent library and SQLite. The [Persistent
chapter](//www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent) in the Yesod Book covers
a lot of what we'll be using Persistent for and much more, so make sure to
refer to it while following this section.

To use Persistent, we're first going to add its dependencies to our
cabal file. Add these entries to your `build-depends` key:

```
                     , monad-logger
                     , persistent
                     , persistent-sqlite
                     , persistent-template
```

You'll have to restart GHCi so it can build these new dependencies.
Exit GHCi with `:quit` and run `stack ghci` again. Stack should
rebuild your project and show you the GHCi prompt.

We'll have to add quite a few more language extensions and imports.
At the top of your `Main.hs`, add the following lines below your current
extensions:

{% highlight haskell %}

{-# LANGUAGE EmptyDataDecls             #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts           #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances          #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GADTs                      #-}
{-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
{-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses      #-}
{-# LANGUAGE QuasiQuotes                #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell            #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies               #-}

{% endhighlight %}

And these imports below your existing ones:

{% highlight haskell %}

import           Control.Monad.Logger    (LoggingT, runStdoutLoggingT)
import           Database.Persist        hiding (get) -- To avoid a naming clash with Web.Spock.get
import qualified Database.Persist        as P         -- We'll be using P.get later for GET /people/<id>.
import           Database.Persist.Sqlite hiding (get)
import           Database.Persist.TH

{% endhighlight %}

Next, we're going to replace our existing `Person` declaration with a
Persistent-specific one. This new one will generate code at compile time
that will allow us to serialise our datatype to SQLite with ease. Find and
remove your `data Person = ...` declaration along with `instance FromJSON`
and `instance ToJSON` and replace them with the following:

{% highlight haskell %}

share [mkPersist sqlSettings, mkMigrate "migrateAll"] [persistLowerCase|
Person json -- The json keyword will make Persistent generate sensible ToJSON and FromJSON instances for us.
  name Text
  age Int
  deriving Show
|]

{% endhighlight %}

This code will (among other things) generate record names for `Person`
that are slightly different to our initial ones: `name` becomes `personName`
and `age` becomes `personAge`. If you change your `Person` definitions in
your `get` function accordingly:

{% highlight haskell %}

    json
      [ Person {personName = "Fry", personAge = 25}
      , Person {personName = "Bender", personAge = 4}
      ]
      
{% endhighlight %}

Then your code should still compile and behave similarly to how it did before the
change. 

## Creating the Connection Pool

Spock's [configuration]({{ page.hackage_base
}}/Spock-0.12.0.0/docs/Web-Spock-Config.html#t:SpockCfg) type includes
a database helper that manages connection pools.  Let's create a SQLite
connection pool and add it to our Spock configuration.  Replace the `spockCfg`
assignment (the `spockCfg <- ...` line) in your `main` function with the
following:

{% highlight haskell %}

  pool <- runStdoutLoggingT $ createSqlitePool "api.db" 5
  spockCfg <- defaultSpockCfg () (PCPool pool) ()

{% endhighlight %}

If we look at [createSqlitePool]({{ page.hackage_base
}}/persistent-sqlite-2.6.2/docs/Database-Persist-Sqlite.html#v:createSqlitePool)'s
type signature, we can see the `MonadLogger m` constraint. This means that
`createSqlitePool` needs to be in a monad that provides logging, so we run
it inside `runStdoutLoggingT` which will print the function's log messages to
standard output, allowing us to see its debug messages in our console.

Because we've changed the structure of our application to contain a
connection pool, we'll have to change our Spock application's types to
reflect this. Change your `Api` type:

{% highlight haskell %}

type Api = SpockM SqlBackend () () ()

{% endhighlight %}

and your `ApiAction` type:

{% highlight haskell %}

type ApiAction a = SpockAction SqlBackend () () a

{% endhighlight %}


## Creating the Schema

Our new `Person` declaration also includes functionality for Persistent to
migrate our schema.  We'll call Persistent's `runMigration` function which
will create our schema for us. Insert this line right below the `spockCfg`
definition:

{% highlight haskell %}

  runStdoutLoggingT $ runSqlPool (do runMigration migrateAll) pool

{% endhighlight %}

The [runSqlPool]({{ page.hackage_base
}}/persistent-2.6.1/docs/src/Database-Persist-Sql-Run.html#runSqlPool)
function, which also needs to be in a `MonadLogger` monad, takes two arguments:
a function that performs actions using a connection from a pool (which here
is wrapped in parentheses), and the pool itself.

# Running Queries

We'll use a small helper function for running queries in our server.
Add the following function to your `Main.hs`:

{% highlight haskell %}

runSQL
  :: (HasSpock m, SpockConn m ~ SqlBackend)
  => SqlPersistT (LoggingT IO) a -> m a
runSQL action = runQuery $ \conn -> runStdoutLoggingT $ runSqlConn action conn

{% endhighlight %}

If you compare the right side of the `runSQL` definition to the migration code in the last
section, you'll see some similarities:

{% highlight haskell %}

  runQuery $ \conn -> runStdoutLoggingT $ runSqlConn action conn                       -- runSQL
                      runStdoutLoggingT $ runSqlPool (do runMigration migrateAll) pool -- migration

{% endhighlight %}

So, our `runSQL` function really just calls `runQuery` and uses the connection it provides
to perform some database actions.

## Adding People

Now we're ready to use our database in our application. Let's change our
`POST /people` function to insert the parsed `Person` into our database and
show an appropriate JSON response. First though, add one one more helper
function to generate simple JSON errors:

{% highlight haskell %}

errorJson :: Int -> Text -> ApiAction ()
errorJson code message =
  json $
    object
    [ "result" .= String "failure"
    , "error" .= object ["code" .= code, "message" .= message]
    ]

{% endhighlight %}

Because it's good practice for an API to always respond with JSON (or your
preferred data format), we'll use this instead of just plain text when
reporting errors. Returning error codes is another good practice that
allows users to troubleshoot issues more easily.

Now change your `post` action to use the `errorJson` function and insert
a person into the database:

{% highlight haskell %}

  post "people" $ do
    maybePerson <- jsonBody :: ApiAction (Maybe Person)
    case maybePerson of
      Nothing -> errorJson 1 "Failed to parse request body as Person"
      Just thePerson -> do
        newId <- runSQL $ insert thePerson
        json $ object ["result" .= String "success", "id" .= newId]

{% endhighlight %}

Reload your project and start the server again. Try adding a couple of people:

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Walter", "age": 50 }' localhost:8080/people
{"result":"success","id":1}
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name": "Jesse", "age": 22 }' localhost:8080/people
{"result":"success","id":2}
```

## Listing People

Now we'll change our `get` action to return a list of all the people in our table:

{% highlight haskell %}

  get "people" $ do
    allPeople <- runSQL $ selectList [] [Asc PersonId]
    json allPeople

{% endhighlight %}

Reload and start the server and go to
[localhost:8080/people](//localhost:8080/people) to see your list.

## Getting a Specific Person

If you look at the JSON response for
[localhost:8080/people](//localhost:8080/people), you should see that your
`Person` objects now have `id` keys.  These values are automatically inserted
by Persistent: we'll use them to get a person by their id. Add the following
route function to your `app`:

{% highlight haskell %}

  get ("people" <//> var) $ \personId -> do
    maybePerson <- runSQL $ P.get personId :: ApiAction (Maybe Person)
    case maybePerson of
      Nothing -> errorJson 2 "Could not find a person with matching id"
      Just thePerson -> json thePerson
      
{% endhighlight %}

And again, reload and try it out: [localhost:8080/people/1](//localhost:8080/people/1).

# Finishing Up: Exercises

We've implemented the foundation of our API and some of the basic
functionality. Practice adding some features yourself by trying out these
exercises:

1. Try adding PUT and DELETE routes yourself. Note that we hid
`Database.Persist.delete` to avoid a naming clash with `Web.Spock.delete`,
so you'll have to use the `P` namespace qualifier.
    <details>
    <summary>
    <strong>Click for hints</strong>
    </summary>
    For the PUT action you'll want to use <code>Web.Spock.put</code> and
    <code>Database.Persist.Class.replace</code>. The Persistent chapter
    in the Yesod Book has an example of using both <code>replace</code>
    and <code>delete</code>.

    For the DELETE action, you may have to explicitly declare your route
    variable as a <code>PersonId</code> so that GHC knows which type of
    database object you want to delete. We've explicitly declared values a
    couple of times in our tutorial, such as decoding to <code>Person</code>
    and <code>Value</code> and when using Spock actions.
    </details>
    <br>

2. It is good practice to set appropriate HTTP status codes, for example:
   - `201 Created` for successful POST and PUT actions
   - `400 Bad Request` for failed POST and PUT actions
   - `404 Not Found` for `GET /people/<id>` route

    Try setting appropriate HTTP status codes for your actions
    <details>
    <summary>
    <strong>Click for hints</strong>
    </summary>
    Look at the type of <code>Web.Spock.Action.setStatus</code>: it takes
    a single argument of type <code>Status</code> and needs to be called
    in a Spock action context. You'll have to add <code>http-types</code>
    to your project dependencies and import its Status module to use the
    <code>Status</code> definitions.
    </details>
    <br>

3. Spock has a error handler for generic errors such missing routes,
runtime exceptions, etc. By default, this returns generic HTML pages. Use
`Web.Spock.Config.spc_errorHandler` to change your application to
return generic JSON error responses. You can try any other route like
[localhost:8080/](//localhost:8080/) to see the default 404 error response.
    <details>
    <summary>
    <strong>Click for hints</strong>
    </summary>
    Your current config datatype is being constructed by passing arguments
    to <code>defaultSpockCfg</code>. You'll want to change this to use the
    records listed in <code>Web.Spock.Config</code> documentation.
    <br>
    The <code>spc_errorHandler</code> type signature shows that it
    takes a <code>Status</code> and returns a Spock action, so you'll
    need write a function that pattern matches on <code>Status</code>
    types introduced in the last exercise and returns JSON errors. If you
    want to use <code>errorJson</code>, you'll have to change its type
    signature to allow both <code>IO</code> and <code>WebStateM</code>
    (<code>SpockAction</code>'s) monads.
    </details>
    <br>
